## üåü Why This Project Stands Out
- **End-to-End AI Integration:** Combines classic web dev with cutting-edge local LLMs for real, practical AI use.
- **Privacy-First:** All AI runs locally‚Äîno user data leaves your machine.
- **Modular & Extensible:** Clean, well-organized codebase makes it easy to add new features or swap components.
- **Real-World Relevance:** Tackles a meaningful problem‚Äîpersonalized health and nutrition.
- **Modern Stack:** Uses the latest in React, TypeScript, Flask, and AI APIs.
- **Beautiful UI:** Professional, responsive design with Material UI.
- **Open Source Spirit:** Built for learning, sharing, and community improvement.

## ü§ù For Developers: How to Contribute & Learn
- **Explore Modular Code:** Each feature (diet, nutrition, LLM, places) is in its own module for clarity.
- **Add Your Own AI Models:** Swap in any OpenAI-compatible LLM in LM Studio‚Äîexperiment with prompts and outputs!
- **Improve the UI/UX:** The React frontend is easy to extend with new pages, themes, or components.
- **API-First Design:** All business logic is exposed via RESTful APIs‚Äîperfect for mobile or other frontends.
- **Learn Best Practices:** See examples of environment config, error handling, and scalable project structure.
- **Contribute:** Fork, branch, and PR! Suggestions, bugfixes, and new features are welcome.
- **Great for Portfolios:** Use this as a template or inspiration for your own AI-powered apps.

## ‚ö° Quickstart

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-diet-assistant.git
cd ai-diet-assistant
```

### 2. Backend Setup
```bash
# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
./venv/Scripts/activate  # On Windows
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Add your .env file (see below)
```

#### .env Example
```
GOOGLE_PLACES_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
FLASK_ENV=development
FLASK_DEBUG=1
```

### 3. Frontend Setup
```bash
cd src/frontend/diet-assistant-ui
npm install
# (Optional) Add .env for API URL
# echo REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000 > .env
npm start
```

### 4. LLM (LM Studio) Setup
- Download and install [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/)
- Download the model: **Phi 3.1 Mini 128k Instruct** (IQ3_M or Q4_K_M recommended)
- Start LM Studio and load the model
- Ensure the OpenAI-compatible API server is running at `http://127.0.0.1:1234`

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage
- Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser
- Sign up or log in (UI only, no real authentication)
- Enter your profile details and generate a personalized diet plan
- Explore meal suggestions, nutrition breakdown, and local healthy options

---

## üîß Customization & Extensibility
- **Add more foods**: Edit `data/food_database.csv`
- **Change LLM prompts**: Edit `src/llm_integration.py`
- **Swap LLM models**: Use any OpenAI-compatible model in LM Studio
- **Add authentication**: Integrate with Firebase/Auth0 or Flask-Login
- **Deploy**: Use Heroku, Vercel, or your preferred cloud provider

---

## ü©∫ Troubleshooting
- **LLM not responding?**
  - Ensure LM Studio is running and model is loaded
  - Check that the model name in `src/llm_integration.py` matches LM Studio
  - Make sure the API URL is `http://127.0.0.1:1234/v1/chat/completions`
- **Google Places not working?**
  - Add a valid API key to your `.env` file
  - Check backend logs for errors
- **Frontend/backend connection issues?**
  - Ensure both servers are running
  - Check CORS settings in Flask
